# typ Website built with React and Gatsby

_Note: This is still a work in progress, expect some functionality to be incomplete._

This is a website built for a printer supplies re-seller in Argentina.
The idea is to build a purely static site to act as the front of the company, and encourage users to contact the company using social media, mostly Whatsapp (the most common in Argentina). It does not have an e-shop yet, but we want to have it presentable enough to at least have something up to attract potential clients.

## Design

I designed the site and colors by myself, and i'm pretty proud of it considering i'm not a designer but a programmer.

## Functionality

### Done

Mobile hamburguer menu, mobile vertical scrolling for the carrousel, menu items for sections.

### Todo

Still missing the web carrousel functionality, some buttons are lacking action, and the contact form is not done.
